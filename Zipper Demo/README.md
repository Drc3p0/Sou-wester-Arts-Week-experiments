### Zipper Demo
One of the biggest challenges has been to have a clear way to emulate a potentiometer with textile applicaitons.  I've been getting around it by 'holding down' a touchpoint so that the code ramps up or down to a specified amount, with an LED indicating the level, but i'd really like a different solution.. 
One simple soluion i've seen is using a zipper that bridges two conductive strips to emulate a sliding pot.

Its probably glitchy as hell, but its the simplest solution I can think of.
