### Controller Gloves
Goal: add capacitive points to the palm of my biker gloves. Probably stick to triggering single MIDI notes as long as contact is being held high.  Integrate Genkii Wave ring with it as a multi-input performance prop. 

Can be controlled with a teensy and wires going to the gloves, but would love to use the [Seeed Studio XIAO ESP32C3](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Seeed-XIAO-ESP32C3-p-5431.html) to send MIDI over bluetooth.  If so, would be powered with either lipo cell, or [14500 3.7V lipo](https://www.makerlab-electronics.com/product/14500-li-ion-3-7v-750mah-rechargeable-battery/) housed in a AA battery holder.
